## Description
This e-commerce application was developed to integrate a back-end system that functions as an inventory management tool. It enables users to classify their products, monitor them through unique IDs, view stock levels, prices, and apply tags to enhance the description and grouping of related items.

## Installation
1. Select a destination on your computer for the application and create a new, empty directory.
2. Download or clone the repository to the location you just created.
3. Navigate to the root directory of the repository and run the command "npm i" to install the required dependencies.
4. Access the MySQL shell by running the command "mysql -u root -p" and enter your password when prompted.
5. Type "source ./db/schema.sql;" to initialize the database and then exit the shell with "exit;"
6. Finally, run the command "npm run seed" to seed the data.

## Use
To begin using the application, navigate to the root directory of the repository and initiate it by running the command "npm start". Next, interact with the application using Insomnia, which will allow you to perform various HTTP requests such as GET, POST, and Delete.
